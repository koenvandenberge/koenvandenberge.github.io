This paper introduces a statistical method to perform differential gene expression analysis along or between lineages of a trajectory. The main data application of this paper is single-cell RNA-sequencing data, although it can also be used for other types of data, e.g. time-series bulk RNA-seq or single-cell ATAC-seq data.
