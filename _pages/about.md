I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley and Ghent University, supervised by [Sandrine Dudoit](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/sandrine/) and [Lieven Clement](https://statomics.github.io/), where I am developing statistical methods to analyze biological high-throughput sequencing data, e.g. (single-cell) RNA-seq data. My research interests include normalization, dimensionality reduction, differential (expression) analysis and multiple testing.
I support open science and open source software.

## Background

I obtained a MSc. in Biology from Ghent University in 2013, and a MSc. in Statistical Data Analysis from Ghent University in 2014.
I have finished my PhD in May 2019, supervised by [Lieven Clement](https://statomics.github.io/), where I have developed statistical methods for differential expression analysis in bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing applications.

## Funding

I am a postdoctoral fellow of the [Belgian American Educational Foundation (BAEF)](https://baef.be/), and of the [Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be). For my PhD, I obtained funding through a strategic PhD grant from the [Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be).
