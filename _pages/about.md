Im a Statistician at Janssen R&D, working on statistical analysis of single-cell datasets with the ultimate goal of improving therapies for important diseases. We analyze datasets and develop statistical methodology for robust population-scale analysis of large single-cell datasets, focussing on single-cell RNA-sequencing and T-cell receptor sequencing. My research interests include normalization, dimensionality reduction, differential (expression) analysis and multiple testing. I support open science and open source software.

Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley and Ghent University, supervised by [Sandrine Dudoit](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/sandrine/) and [Lieven Clement](https://statomics.github.io/), where I developed statistical methods to analyze biological high-throughput sequencing data, e.g. (single-cell) RNA-seq data. 

## Background

I obtained a MSc. in Biology from Ghent University in 2013, and a MSc. in Statistical Data Analysis from Ghent University in 2014.
I have finished my PhD in May 2019, supervised by [Lieven Clement](https://statomics.github.io/), where I have developed statistical methods for differential expression analysis in bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing applications.
