I am a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley and Ghent University, supervised by [Sandrine Dudoit](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/sandrine/) and [Lieven Clement](https://statomics.github.io/).
During my post-doc, I am developing statistical methods to analyze biological high-throughput sequencing data, e.g. (single-cell) RNA-seq data. My reserach interests include normalization, dimensionality reduction, differential expression analysis and multiple testing.
I support open science and open source software.

## Background

I obtained a Msc. in Biology from Ghent University in 2013, after which I obtained a Msc. in Statistical Data Analysis from Ghent University in 2014.
I have obtained my PhD in 2019, supervised by [Lieven Clement](https://statomics.github.io/), where I have developed statistical methods for differential expression analysis in bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing applications.

## Funding

I am a postodoctoral fellow of the [Belgian American Educational Foundation (BAEF)](https://www.baef.be), and of the [Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be).
